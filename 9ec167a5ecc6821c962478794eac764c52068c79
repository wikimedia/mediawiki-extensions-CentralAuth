To avoid this we could have four messages:\n\n \"centralauth-block-local-page\"\n \"centralauth-block-local-page-final\"\n \"centralauth-block-local-namespace\"\n \"centralauth-block-local-namespace-final\"\n\nThe two messages ending \"-final\" would be identical to their counterparts, but beginning with \"... and\" in English.\n\nA better solution in my opinion would be not to use \"... and\", and only use these two messages:\n\n \"centralauth-block-local-page\"\n \"centralauth-block-local-namespace\"\n\nThis way the messages are less complicated, and the list is visually more consistent.
