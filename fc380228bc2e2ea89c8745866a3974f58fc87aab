These are exactly the ones listed below.\n\nHowever, since this is a value from a user request, it\u0027s possible to pass an unsupported value. The old code crashed in this case. The new code as proposed in patch set 1 silently ignores this error. Can we avoid this and introduce something like `default: throw new InvalidArgumentException( \u0027â€¦\u0027 )`?",
