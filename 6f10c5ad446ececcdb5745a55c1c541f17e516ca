      "message": "Hmm, so addUser checks $wgCentralAuthAutoNew as well. Technically the account already exists, so I don\u0027t think it should depend on that global. I\u0027ll just take the two lines that function actually does and directly call them.\n\nExcept...I dug a bit further and CentralAuthUser::register (called by $wgAuth-\u003eaddUser()) wants the user\u0027s raw password, which we don\u0027t have access too. Not sure what to do.. :/",
