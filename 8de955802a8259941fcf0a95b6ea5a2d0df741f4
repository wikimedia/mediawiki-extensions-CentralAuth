(FWIW recent Postgres has both functions.)\n\nWould it be nicer to put this in a Database* function with \"not implemented\" exceptions for the other languages, so that someone looking for missing Oracle/etc features can more easily find it?",

For the current 128-bit salt you need ~ 10^38 tries; with commercially available specialized hardware like https://gist.github.com/epixoip/8171031 you can do something like 10^18 per year. And that only breaks the tokens for a single batch.",
