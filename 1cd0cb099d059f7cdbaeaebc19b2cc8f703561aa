      "message": "Multiple issues with this line of code:\n* What is counted here? This is not obvious from the code alone, and no comment explains it.\n* Currently this will add the new parameter as $4, I believe, because $1 is the link, and $2 and $3 are from the two elements $args array. But this code is fragile, because it is disjoint from the code that constructs the $args array above. This can easily break any time somebody else continues working on this code. Please move this up to where $args is created.\n* The $params are constructed in SpecialWikiSets::doSubmit via array( $name, $type, implode( \u0027, \u0027, $wikis ) ). $params[2] is a string. It can\u0027t be counted. This will always return 1, I believe. I suggest to not add the additional parameter here, but add it in SpecialWikiSets::doSubmit. However, I\u0027m not sure what implications this haves. The number will probably appear in log entries and possibly confuse people there.",
