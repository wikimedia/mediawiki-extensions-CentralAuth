It doesn\u0027t even (indirectly or not) extend the ResourceLoaderWikiModule.\n\nI guess this has to do with the fact that it should only be registered on other wikis and then loaded cross-domain to where the other class is registered locally.\n\nBut on its own this looks broken, perhaps add a little comment here or construct this differently (do we need the class in order to add a load call?)",
