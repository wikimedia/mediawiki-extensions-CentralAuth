      "message": "Yes, users come first. :)\n\nhttps://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ResourceLoader/Architecture#Principles\n\n\nI think we can greatly reduce confusion by giving the module a better name, and adding a file comment. For example:\n\n* Rename \"ext.centralauth.globalrenameuser\" to \"ext.centralauth.globalrename\"\n* Add this there.\n* Give each JS file a file comment explaining which special page it is for, with conditional on wgCanonicalSpecialPageName it is on.\n\nThe module is just a bundle for delivering a collection of bits. The alternative is to have 1 bundle for all MW core/ext code in one. Most big websites do that actually, like GitHub, and Facebook. They have maybe 5-10 or so big bundles for regular page views (not inc. interactive features).\n\nModules are not meant to have a feature mapping of any kind. I regret making it look that way for 10 years. It\u0027s my fault :)",
