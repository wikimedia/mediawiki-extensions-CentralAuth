      "message": "I think you might be right.\n\nThe \"mobile\" target is set by the Minerva skin – and others, probably – but can be set by anything with a reference to the OutputPage object (see OutputPage#setTarget).\n\nWhen MobileFrontend is enabled and the host matches a certain pattern, then the current (default, maybe?) skin is overwritten with the Minerva skin.\n\nIf you were to set this target to mobile, then you\u0027re restricting the module to a skin and not to a domain, which I think is what I was assuming in my first comment.",
