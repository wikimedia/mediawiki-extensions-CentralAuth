      "message": "User foo has local accounts on hewiki and enwiki, both the same password. Accounts renamed to foo~hewiki and foo~enwiki and globalized. If the user logs into hewiki as foo, login fails, we query the db and get (foo~enwiki, foo~hewiki), and attempt to login user foo~enwiki with the password. The login succeeds. So they\u0027re logged in as foo~enwiki on hewiki... which seems like it would cause confusion if they immediately try and request a rename. Or worse, make an edit, then they have 2 foo~X accounts on the wiki that will need to be merged.\n\nOTOH, you can make the case we\u0027ll need to merge the accounts anyway, so a one more place to merge probably isn\u0027t the end of the world.\n\nBut I\u0027d rather not make life more difficult if we can avoid it.",
