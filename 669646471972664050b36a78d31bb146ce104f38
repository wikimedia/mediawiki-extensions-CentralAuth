      "message": "So that\u0027s going to put a lot of extra object in memcache. I was originally thinking of adding something on the already cached CentralAuthUser object to flag if it\u0027s being renamed. Then you just have to purge it when you start a rename, and it\u0027s an extra join when we\u0027re already querying the db.\n\nThis approach wouldn\u0027t be horrible, but if we can find a way to only cache when we\u0027re renaming, that would be better.",
