      "message": "The comments on MWOAuthUtils::getCentralUserNameFromId indicate that attachment should be checked by the hook. Looking at the use for the Utils function, I think the only place attachment is assumed is MWOAuthConsumerSubmitControl::getLogTItle. If the user isn\u0027t attached there, then the log title wouldn\u0027t really make sense, unless we say \u003cuser\u003e@global.\n\nShould we split the function (and hooks?), one for getting the username, and one for testing if the user is attached?",

      "message": "If the comments say to check this then they are wrong. Only the function getting the User object needs that.\n\nNormally the global name is the local name except for some special cases and this is just used for showing usernames/links so it generally should be fine. I don\u0027t want the names/links to break just because a user becomes unattached though (which could a problem for some of the special pages).\n\nMaybe some other patch could maybe make getLogTitle() try to get the name from the local attached user and fallback to blah@global or something like that. Alternatively, we could always use @global I guess.",
