Looking into `Title::secureAndSplit()`, I see that one time, the public property `::mDefaultNamespace` is accessed, and a few lines down in the same function, it is obtained by calling `::getDefaultNamespace()`. I guess I am just lacking experience. Is there any good reading you could recommend that would someone allow to understand (except perhaps git blame and doing a lot of history digging) such decisions?",
