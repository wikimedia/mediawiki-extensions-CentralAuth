      "message": "Checking the values in the business logic as well is reasonable. I do that in the hook and I\u0027ll make sure that I do it in the special page as well. I don\u0027t see that installing conditionally is \"hard\". This anon function actually works. I started to make a prettier callback and then noticed that there is one wgExtensionsFunction hook here already and another config block that really should be moved to a hook as well. It seems like this would be nicer to clean up all together. I could make another patch to do that and then rebase this on that once it is merged (or mergeable).",
